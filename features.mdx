## Planned

### Liquidation address (planned)
Each user will receive a unique Solana address. Send any Solana token to this address and we will automatically convert it to USDC and send it to the user's linked IBAN or routing number account. This acts as an on chain off ramp address users can save in Phantom without visiting the app. 

### Cards (planned)
- **Virtual and physical cards** - Spending from your account balance with controls and notifications

### Developer APIs (planned)
- **REST APIs and webhooks** - Create accounts, send payouts, reconcile, and more
- **Sandbox** - Safe environment for testing

### Token alignment (planned)
- **$KARMA** - We intend to link platform benefits to token holders and explore using a portion of fees for buybacks. Details will be shared prior to launch.
