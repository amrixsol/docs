description: "A self-custody, compliant replacement for bank accounts for individuals and businesses."

Money is trapped in closed networks and custodial platforms. We’re building Karma so anyone can hold, move, and use money like a bank account - while staying in self‑custody and on modern, programmable rails.

## What’s broken

- You don’t own your money without keys
- Rails are fragmented (IBANs in EU, routing in US, cards elsewhere)
- Compliance is bolted on and painful

## What we believe

- Own your keys, own your money
- Compliant by design through regulated partners
- One wallet for all rails (IBANs, routing, cards)
- Programmable money movement where it helps

## Built for everyone

- Individuals: receive with IBAN/routing, keep self‑custody, move between fiat and stablecoins
- Businesses: issue accounts, run payouts and payroll, get auditability from day one

## Good Karma: banking that does good

- A portion of our revenue goes to vetted causes; using Karma helps fund real‑world impact
- You earn "Good Karma" on activity - your balances are never reduced; contributions come from us
- Choose impact categories (e.g., climate, education, open‑source) and change them anytime
- Transparent, auditable receipts in app
- Businesses can optionally set programmatic rules to route a small share of volume to impact funds

## What we’re shipping

- Accounts: IBANs and US routing/account numbers in your wallet
- Payments: fast global transfers and on/off‑ramps
- Cards & APIs: planned

## Why it matters

Same utility as a bank account, plus global reach, programmability, and user control.
