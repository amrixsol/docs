## Current status

\$KARMA is live on Believe.

- Fees per swap: 2% total
  - 0.4% protocol fee to Meteora
  - 1.6% to the Karma treasury (under our agreement with Believe)
- Treasury split: 50% \$KARMA and 50% SOL
- Purpose: grow protocol-held supply/liquidity and fund operations
 - Circulating impact: 50% of fees accrue in \$KARMA, reducing circulating supply on every trade

Product integration is in progress; no in-app utility is active yet.

## Vision

Align platform performance with token holder upside, responsibly and compliantly.

## Planned utility (exploration)

- Fee alignment for activity tiers
- Possible use of a portion of fees for buybacks or utility
- Access tiers and higher limits
- Governance signaling first, then formalization if appropriate

None of the above is live today; details will be announced before launch.

## Not live yet

- No staking, yield, or liquidity mining
- No fee discounts
- No governance portal
- Token not required to use current features

## Holding and storage
