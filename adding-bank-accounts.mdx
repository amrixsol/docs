Connect a personal bank account so you can withdraw USDC to EUR or USD. We use Bridge to verify and validate bank details; you stay in self‑custody and we never store banking credentials.

## What we support

- **EU (SEPA)** - Link an IBAN account for EUR payouts
- **US (ACH/wire)** - Link a routing + account number for USD payouts
- Other corridors are planned

## Link a bank account (in app)

1. Go to "Bank accounts" in the dashboard and select "Add"
2. Choose region (EU or US) and enter your bank details
3. Complete Bridge verification (may include micro‑deposits in the US)
4. Confirm the last 4 digits and save

Once linked, you can withdraw USDC to your bank from the "Withdraw" flow.

## Security & compliance

- Verification handled by Bridge; we never store bank passwords
- Only masked details are shown in app (e.g., last 4)
- Additional checks or proof of address may be requested by Bridge depending on region

## Developers

Public APIs for linking external accounts are planned. Today, account linking happens inside the app.
