These requirements are used by our compliance partners when verifying your address.

## Customers who may be asked for proof of address

- Individuals with government ID from a controlled/prohibited region while claiming residence elsewhere, or conflicting location signals
- Businesses with conflicting location signals (for example, operating in a low‑risk region but registered in a high‑risk region, or control person residing in a high‑risk region)
- As needed, when requested for additional verification

## Document requirements

### Businesses

A business proof of address must:
