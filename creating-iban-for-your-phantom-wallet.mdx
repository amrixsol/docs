Generate a European IBAN that maps directly to your Phantom wallet. Incoming EUR auto‑converts to USDC and lands in your wallet.

## Create in two clicks

1. In Accounts, click "Generate IBAN"
2. Connect Phantom and sign once

That’s it. Your IBAN and transfer instructions (IBAN, BIC, beneficiary name, reference if needed) are shown immediately.

## Notes

- Requires Bridge KYC
- SEPA EUR incoming transfers are supported
- We never hold your keys; you can relink the wallet later if needed
