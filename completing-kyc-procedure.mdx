Know Your Customer (KYC) is required to unlock banking features. Bridge handles verification for Karma.

## Why it matters

- Required by regulation to enable banking features
- Prevents fraud and keeps the platform safe

## What KYC unlocks

- Generate IBANs and US routing/account numbers
- Link bank accounts for withdrawals
- Higher limits and future card access

## What you'll need

- One government ID (passport, driver's license, national ID, or residence permit)
- Recent proof of address (bank statement, utility bill, tax document, or lease; within 3 months)

## How to complete

1) Open Verification in the app and start KYC
2) Enter your legal details
3) Upload your ID and complete a selfie check
4) Upload proof of address if requested
5) Submit and wait for approval

## Timing

- Most reviews complete quickly. If there's no decision after 48 business hours, contact support.

## Common issues

- Blurry or cropped documents → retake with good lighting and include all corners
- Expired/wrong document type → use a valid accepted ID
- Name/address mismatches → match exactly what is on your documents

## After you're approved

- Create an IBAN or US routing/account number
- Link a bank account for withdrawals

## Privacy

- We never ask for passwords or private keys
- Documents are handled by Bridge and transmitted securely
