Karma’s flywheel is simple: real revenue powers the token, and the token aligns everyone around product growth. More volume through IBANs, routing numbers, and payouts means more revenue, which strengthens the treasury and improves the product, which brings more volume.

## The loop

1. Use the product - connect wallet, create IBAN/routing, move funds
2. Volume generates real fees on rails we operate with partners
3. Treasury grows (LP fees from Believe, etc.) and improves resilience
4. Better product and pricing attract more users and use cases

## Why this works

- Revenue over speculation - actual usage drives the economy
- Shared upside - a healthier treasury and product benefit users and token holders
- Compounding effects - better product → more volume → more revenue → better product

That’s the flywheel we are building.
