### 🎨 Welcome Screen Redesign

The welcome screen has been refreshed with a new visual design, delivering a more polished first impression when you open the app.

### ✉️ Updated Email Branding

All email flows now feature updated logos and branding, keeping everything consistent with the latest Karma identity.

### 🔑 Redesigned Password & Email Flows

Both the reset password and change email address email flows have been completely redesigned for a cleaner, more intuitive experience.

### 📊 Updated Tickers UI on Home Screen

The market tickers on the Home Screen have been refreshed with an updated layout for a cleaner look at crypto prices.

### 💳 Improved Home Screen Transactions

The transaction list on the Home Screen has been upgraded with better visual hierarchy, larger icons, and a more intuitive layout for quickly reviewing your recent activity.

### 💲 Better Amount Formatting

Transaction amounts across the app now display with proper formatting—`$1,988.55` instead of `$1988.55`—making large numbers easier to read at a glance.

Card transactions now show recognizable merchant logos and category-specific icons (food, transport, shopping, and more) instead of generic placeholders, making it easier to identify your spending.

### ⚡ Card Authorization Speed Boost

Card transactions now authorize significantly faster. We've optimized our balance verification system to deliver near-instant authorization decisions, reducing wait times at checkout. This improvement ensures a smoother payment experience whether you're shopping online or in-store.

### 🔄 Automated Refund Processing

When transactions are declined after funds have been reserved, refunds are now processed automatically. No more waiting for manual intervention—affected users receive their funds back promptly without needing to contact support.

### 📡 Real-Time Balance Updates

Your card wallet balance now updates in real-time as deposits arrive. Previously, balance updates could take a few seconds to reflect—now incoming funds are recognized instantly, so you can spend immediately after topping up your card.

### 🌍 KYC Country Selection Updates

We've updated the list of available countries in our identity verification flow to better reflect supported regions. The country selection UI now accurately displays only the jurisdictions where Karma card services are currently available, providing a cleaner onboarding experience.

### 🔐 Authentication Screen Improvements

The authentication screen now correctly distinguishes between new sign-ups and returning users. Previously, new users would sometimes see "Welcome back" messaging during their first registration—this has been resolved to ensure the right welcome experience for everyone.

### 👤 Name Information Now Saves Correctly

Fixed an issue where user names weren't being saved during the card verification process. This caused some users to see "Card Holder" instead of their actual name when viewing card details. Names are now properly persisted and existing affected users will have their information automatically synced.

### 🔄 KYC Rejection Handling

Added comprehensive support for handling identity verification rejections and denials. Users whose applications were previously declined can now start fresh applications without getting stuck in error states. The system properly clears old verification data and provides clear messaging about next steps.

### ⚡ Infrastructure Upgrade for Scale

We've upgraded our Turnkey wallet infrastructure to support 100,000+ users with improved reliability and performance. This upgrade ensures Karma can continue to scale while maintaining fast and secure wallet operations for all users.

### 💰 Karma Sponsors All On-Chain Fees

Karma now covers all Solana transaction fees, rent costs, and token account creation fees on behalf of users. This means you no longer need SOL in your wallet to perform transfers—Karma handles all blockchain costs so you can focus on using your funds without worrying about gas fees.

### 💵 Amount Handling Standardization

### 🔗 PDA Support for Rain Deposit Addresses

Added support for Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for Rain deposit addresses. This enhancement enables more flexible on-chain deposit routing and improves compatibility with Solana's account model for card funding operations.

### ⚡ Faster Card Authorization

Optimized card authorization speed by shifting the source of truth to on-chain data powered by Helius. Card transactions now verify balances directly from the blockchain in real-time, resulting in faster approval times and more reliable authorization decisions.

### 💳 Card Wallet Withdrawal Endpoints

Added withdrawal endpoints for the card-linked wallet, enabling users to move funds from their card wallet back to their main wallet or external addresses. This provides greater flexibility in managing card balances and gives users full control over their funds.

Redesigned the terms and agreements flow in the mobile app with a cleaner, more intuitive interface. Users can now review and accept required agreements with improved readability and a more professional presentation.

Added a dedicated success state for the card creation flow, providing clear visual confirmation when a user's card has been successfully created. This gives users confidence that their card is ready to use.

### ✓ Bank Verification & Microdeposit Tracking

We now track and display all bank verification microdeposits in your transaction history. When connecting external bank accounts through PayPal, Stripe, or other platforms, you can now see the exact microdeposit amounts directly in Karma. This makes account verification flows seamless and transparent, with microdeposits clearly labeled with a professional "Micro-deposit" badge and neutral gray styling to distinguish them from regular transactions.

### 🔄 Enhanced Transaction Status Tracking

Your transaction history now properly reflects all transaction states including refunds, scheduled transfers, and under-review deposits. Previously, refunded deposits would remain stuck in processing status—now they immediately update to show the refund with clear orange indicators. We've also added support for tracking ACH scheduled transfers and deposits under manual review, giving you complete visibility into every transaction's lifecycle.

### 🎨 Professional Transaction UI Refinements

We've refined the transaction interface with a more sophisticated color system that better communicates transaction types. Microdeposits use subtle gray tones, refunds display in orange, deposits remain green, and withdrawals stay red. All badges now follow our high-end design system with consistent shadows, spacing, and typography for a cleaner, more professional appearance that matches our Figma designs.
