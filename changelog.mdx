### 🚀 Changelog Launch

We've officially launched this changelog to keep our community informed about all development activity and product updates. This is the first step towards our vision of a unified community portal where holders can stay informed, submit proposals, and participate in governance.

### 🐋 Inner Circle Requirements Updated

Following a community vote by our whale group, we've updated the [Inner Circle](https://www.karmapay.xyz/innercircle) requirements from 1M to 3M $KARMA. This exclusive group continues to play an important role in shaping the future of Karma through direct input and governance participation.

### 💬 Community Telegram Upgraded

We've upgraded our community Telegram with Safeguard protection and refreshed branding. These improvements help keep our community safe while providing a more polished experience that reflects our evolving brand identity.

### 📚 Documentation Improvements

Various improvements have been made across our documentation portal to provide clearer guidance and better user experience. We're committed to making Karma as accessible and easy to understand as possible.

### ⚡ Faster Payment Rails

We've upgraded our payment infrastructure to support ACH Same-Day and SEPA Instant transfers, significantly reducing withdrawal times. To support these premium rails while keeping Karma self-sustainable during this early stage, off-ramps now include a small flat fee: $1.45 for SEPA and $0.95 for ACH Same-Day. We remain committed to keeping fees as low as possible as we continue to grow.
