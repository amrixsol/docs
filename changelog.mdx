All updates and announcements in one place. We're building towards a community portal combining changelogs, proposals, and holder votes—making Karma a true community-driven product.

### ✓ Bank Verification & Microdeposit Tracking

We now track and display all bank verification microdeposits in your transaction history. When connecting external bank accounts through PayPal, Stripe, or other platforms, you can now see the exact microdeposit amounts directly in Karma. This makes account verification flows seamless and transparent, with microdeposits clearly labeled with a professional "Micro-deposit" badge and neutral gray styling to distinguish them from regular transactions.

### 🔄 Enhanced Transaction Status Tracking

Your transaction history now properly reflects all transaction states including refunds, scheduled transfers, and under-review deposits. Previously, refunded deposits would remain stuck in processing status—now they immediately update to show the refund with clear orange indicators. We've also added support for tracking ACH scheduled transfers and deposits under manual review, giving you complete visibility into every transaction's lifecycle.

### 🎨 Professional Transaction UI Refinements

We've refined the transaction interface with a more sophisticated color system that better communicates transaction types. Microdeposits use subtle gray tones, refunds display in orange, deposits remain green, and withdrawals stay red. All badges now follow our high-end design system with consistent shadows, spacing, and typography for a cleaner, more professional appearance that matches our Figma designs.

### 📊 Account Overview Redesign

The Accounts page has been completely redesigned with a high-end, professional look. New features include time period filtering for transaction stats (7D, 30D, 90D, All-time), clickable IBANs with copy-to-clipboard functionality and toast notifications, and a cleaner layout for virtual accounts. Account holder names now display dynamically when available.

### 📜 Transaction History

View your complete transaction history with a redesigned high-end interface. Features include smart pagination for fast loading, search and filter functionality, transaction summaries showing deposits and withdrawals at a glance, and direct links to blockchain explorers. The page now loads 20 transactions at a time with "Load more" for optimal performance.

### 📱 Mobile UI Improvements

Comprehensive mobile experience upgrade across all pages. The bottom navigation now stays fixed when scrolling, transaction headers stack properly on smaller screens, currency amounts display with proper formatting, and card visuals scale beautifully on mobile devices.

### 💳 Add Account UX

When adding a bank account, users are now guided to use Bill Pay for third-party payments. This clearer messaging helps prevent confusion and ensures withdrawals go to the user's own accounts as required.

### 🔗 Social Share Preview Fix

Updated Open Graph meta tags to ensure social media platforms like Telegram properly display our latest preview images when sharing Karma links.

### ✉️ Email Address Updates

You can now update your email address directly from the Settings page. This change syncs across both Karma and our banking partner, ensuring your account stays connected while giving you flexibility to manage your email. Perfect for users who need to transfer or change their primary email while keeping their Karma account intact.

### 🔄 Transaction Reliability Improvements

We've improved our transaction tracking system to ensure more accurate status updates. Transactions now properly sync with our banking partner's webhook events, and abandoned transactions are automatically cleaned up after 15 minutes. This means cleaner transaction history and more reliable status reporting across the board.

### 🚀 Changelog Launch

We've officially launched this changelog to keep our community informed about all development activity and product updates. This is the first step towards our vision of a unified community portal where holders can stay informed, submit proposals, and participate in governance.

### 🐋 Inner Circle Requirements Updated

Following a community vote by our whale group, we've updated the [Inner Circle](https://www.karmapay.xyz/innercircle) requirements from 1M to 3M \$KARMA. This exclusive group continues to play an important role in shaping the future of Karma through direct input and governance participation.

### 💬 Community Telegram Upgraded

We've upgraded our community Telegram with Safeguard protection and refreshed branding. These improvements help keep our community safe while providing a more polished experience that reflects our evolving brand identity.

### 📚 Documentation Improvements

Various improvements have been made across our documentation portal to provide clearer guidance and better user experience. We're committed to making Karma as accessible and easy to understand as possible.

### ⚡ Faster Payment Rails

We've upgraded our payment infrastructure to support ACH Same-Day and SEPA Instant transfers, significantly reducing withdrawal times. To support these premium rails while keeping Karma self-sustainable during this early stage, off-ramps now include a small flat fee: \$1.45 for SEPA and \$0.95 for ACH Same-Day. We remain committed to keeping fees as low as possible as we continue to grow.
