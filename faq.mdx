## Common payment questions

#### I have a question about a payment. How can I contact support?

Reach the Karma team at team@karmapay.xyz or via Telegram at https://t.me/karmawallet. Please avoid contacting our banking partners directly, as they are not best suited to help you.

#### My funds are missing or have not landed in my account.

Contact us at team@karmapay.xyz or Telegram and we will investigate. If you sent funds from your bank, request a Trace ID for an ACH payment or an IMAD for a wire from your bank. Sharing this helps us locate the transaction faster.

#### When will the funds land in the account?

Next-day ACH typically arrives in 1–3 business days. Same-day ACH sent before 4 p.m. ET arrives the same day. Wires are processed the same business day when received before 5 p.m. ET.

#### What is the minimum amount that I can send or receive?

Minimums can vary by payment rail and counterparty. The app surfaces any limits before you confirm. If something looks off, contact support.

#### Where do I input the memo when making a payment?

Enter the memo in your bank’s Memo/Reference field when creating the ACH or wire. For some banks, the field is labeled “Message to Recipient.” If unsure, check with your bank.

## My bank doesn’t recognize the routing number. What should I do?

Lead Bank routing numbers are 101019644 (virtual accounts) and 101206101 (most memo‑based payments). They are listed on the Federal Reserve’s website at https://frbservices.org. The American Bankers Association (ABA) also provides a routing lookup tool.

If you see errors, contact your bank’s support and inform them these routing numbers are listed on the sites above and should be recognized for wires and ACH.

## Virtual account FAQs

#### Does Karma provide SWIFT codes or international account numbers?

Virtual accounts do not currently support SWIFT. They support ACH and US domestic wires.

#### My bank did a microdeposit to my virtual account. How do I get the amounts?

Notifications for microdeposits are sent to your chosen contact method (e.g., email). It may take up to 1 business day for microdeposits to arrive.

#### I’m being asked for a 3‑letter code by Plaid that was sent to my virtual account. Where can I find it?

The 3‑letter code appears in the microdeposit descriptor.

#### What types of transactions can I receive in my virtual account?
