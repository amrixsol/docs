Get set up in minutes. Connect your wallet, complete Bridge onboarding, and generate banking details to move money between your bank and wallet.

## What you need

- Email and phone number
- Phantom (or another Solana wallet) for self‑custody
- Personal details for Bridge KYC (name, address, date of birth)
- Identification numbers where required (SSN for US, national ID for non‑US). Proof of address may be requested for certain regions or SEPA access

For detailed requirements and edge cases, see [Completing KYC procedure](/completing-kyc-procedure).

## Quick setup

1. Go to [app.karmapay.xyz](https://app.karmapay.xyz) and create an account. Verify your email
2. Connect Phantom and sign to confirm ownership
3. Complete Bridge onboarding with your personal information. High‑risk or higher‑volume users may be asked for source of funds and expected usage
4. Generate a virtual IBAN or US routing/account number
5. (Optional) Add your personal bank accounts to withdraw USDC to EUR/USD

## What you can do next

- Receive on virtual IBAN/routing numbers and auto‑convert to USDC in your wallet
- Withdraw USDC to your connected bank accounts in EUR or USD
- Manage everything from your self‑custody wallet; we never hold your keys

## Security

- Use a strong, unique password and enable 2FA
- Only use official links and verify signatures in your wallet
