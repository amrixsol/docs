Karma is an on‑chain neobank built for the world to use crypto and stablecoins as everyday money. We combine real bank accounts, payment cards, and instant payments with self‑custodial rails, bridging traditional banking and decentralized finance in one wallet.

Our aim is simple: replace fragmented financial tools with a primary banking experience that works across borders and settles instantly, while aligning finance with positive impact.

## What we are building

- **Real bank coordinates**: Receive and send with real IBANs and Routing Numbers.
- **Cards and payments**: Use stablecoins like cash, tap, pay, and move value globally.
- **Instant settlement**: Crypto‑native finality with traditional rails compatibility.
- **Cross‑border by default**: One wallet that works wherever your money needs to go.
- **Your money, your keys**: Hold keys when you want self‑custody; your funds remain yours.

## Earn Good Karma

A portion of our fees goes to vetted charities. On every transaction you complete, you earn "Good Karma" because part of what we earn is directed to impact. Your balances are never reduced for donations; the contribution comes from us. You will be able to see and track the impact your activity helps fund.

## Bridge between crypto and banking

Karma connects stablecoins and on‑chain settlement with regulated fiat rails. You get the speed, transparency, and control of crypto with the familiarity and reach of traditional accounts and payments.

<Note>
  Karma Fintech is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services and issued cards (where applicable) are provided by regulated partners.
